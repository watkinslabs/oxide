// Kernel library. The actual binary is the per-arch boot crate
// (`crates/boot-x86_64`, `crates/boot-aarch64`) which provides the
// arch `_start` symbol, sets up a minimal env, then tail-calls
// `kernel_main`.
//
// This library is `#![no_std]`; it compiles on host so hosted unit
// tests can exercise everything that doesn't require asm.
//
// Phase 0 exit goal per `00§3`: hello-world boots both arches via
// QEMU, prints "init started" on UART, exits cleanly. The string is
// emitted here; the UART backend is wired by the per-arch boot
// crate.
