//! CPU kernel dispatch — single detect+match at the dispatch site,
//! propagated through the inner pipeline as a generic parameter so
//! leaf hot-path code monomorphises against the chosen kernel.
//!
//! See issue #247 for the architecture rationale: per-subsystem
//! dispatch scatters the choice across HUF / FSE / SIMD-copy
//! independently and pays the cost N times per call. Lifting the
//! dispatch to the outermost feasible call site collapses it to one
//! detect there; the inner leaf-hot-path ops then route through
//! `K::method` calls on the chosen kernel zero-sized type.
//!
//! Current wiring (as of #247 Part 2): the only active dispatch site
//! is `decoding::literals_section_decoder::decompress_literals`,
//! which `match`es `detect_cpu_kernel()` and routes into per-K
//! `decompress_literals_*` `#[target_feature]` wrappers. The full
//! pipeline-wide propagation envisioned in the issue (FrameDecoder /
//! FrameCompressor entry, sequence executor, match copy) is
//! incremental; subsequent tiers extend the dispatch surface without
//! changing this trait or the kernel ZSTs.
//!
//! Structure code (block loop, FCS check, offset history, repeat
//! semantics) stays single-impl and only carries `K` as a phantom on
//! the outer function. Monomorphisation specialises ONLY the bodies
//! that actually differ per ISA — `mask_lower_bits`, `huf_burst`,
//! `copy_chunk`, etc.
