//! `BufferBackend` — the compile-time-dispatched interface for the
//! decoder's output storage.
//!
//! Two concrete impls live alongside this module:
//! [`super::ringbuffer::RingBuffer`] (full wrap-aware semantics, default)
//! and [`super::flat_buf::FlatBuf`] (no-wrap fast path used when the
//! frame header's `Single_Segment_flag` guarantees the decompressed
//! output never exceeds `window_size` and so never wraps).
//!
//! Selection happens through the generic parameter on
//! [`super::decode_buffer::DecodeBuffer<B>`] and cascades through
//! `DecoderScratch<B>` to the block-level decode functions. The
//! compiler monomorphises each backend independently and erases the
//! wrap-checking code path entirely on the flat side — see backlog
//! item #132. An earlier attempt with a runtime `enum BufferStorage`
//! paid match-dispatch overhead in every push/repeat and measured a
//! +43–58 % regression on small-frame decompress benchmarks, so the
//! compile-time generic shape is load-bearing.
