// ModeType::Predefined fires whenever the encoder declares that an
// LL / OF / ML symbol stream follows the RFC 8878 default
// distribution (§3.1.1.3.2.1.1). On small-block fixtures this can
// dominate the decode budget: building the table costs O(table_size)
// per axis plus several `Vec::resize` round-trips, while the symbol
// stream itself is only a few hundred bytes.
//
// Flamegraph on `small-4k-log-lines/c_stream/pure_rust` (i9, post
// PR #263 merge) showed 66.72% of decode time in
// `FSETable::build_decoding_table`, all of it inside the Predefined
// branches.
//
// The default distributions are static — the tables they produce
// are byte-identical across calls. Pre-build once via OnceLock,
// then `reinit_from` the cached table into the per-frame scratch.
// `reinit_from` reuses the existing `decode` Vec allocation when the
// capacity already fits (it does, the scratch is re-used across
// frames), copying only the `decode` entries + `accuracy_log` +
// `symbol_probabilities` content. The build-only `symbol_spread_buffer`
// is NOT copied — `reinit_from` only `reserve`s capacity for it —
// shaving the spread-buffer memcpy that the prior `clone_from` did.
//
// Std-only because `OnceLock` lives in `std::sync` — there is no
// `core::sync::OnceLock` (the only stable OnceLock-style API
// requires std). `no_std` builds fall back to the per-call rebuild
// path via the `#[cfg(feature = "std")]` gate. The
// `critical-section` Cargo feature already flagged in the manifest
// is the planned route to extend the cache to no-atomic targets
// without pulling in `once_cell`.
//
// The build step is infallible by construction: the source
// distribution slices are compile-time constants verified against
// the RFC 8878 reference, and `build_from_probabilities` only fails
// on malformed input (sum mismatch, oversized acc_log, symbol >
// max). Treating a failure here as a panic is correct — it would
// mean a static array literal is mathematically broken, which is a
// compile-time bug, not a runtime data condition. Returning
// `&'static FSETable` (infallible) lets `OnceLock::get_or_init`
// handle the cache primitive directly without a fallible-init
// shim.
