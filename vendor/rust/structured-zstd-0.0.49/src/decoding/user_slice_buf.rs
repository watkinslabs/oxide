//! User-slice-backed output buffer for the "decode straight into the
//! caller's output slice" fast path.
//!
//! Selected automatically by
//! [`crate::decoding::FrameDecoder::decode_all`] (and
//! [`crate::decoding::FrameDecoder::decode_all_to_vec`]) when ALL of
//! the following hold:
//! - `frame_content_size > 0` — the header-derived content size
//!   is non-zero. This is the actual eligibility condition (NOT
//!   "FCS present"): an empty frame with an explicit FCS=0
//!   declaration on the wire stays on the fallback path because
//!   there is no payload to write into the user slice. To
//!   distinguish "FCS absent" from "FCS=0 explicit" elsewhere in
//!   the decoder, use `FrameHeader::fcs_declared()` (e.g. the
//!   fallback path's post-decode size check does).
//! - `output.len() >= frame_content_size` — the slice holds the
//!   declared content. No `WILDCOPY_OVERLENGTH` slack is required:
//!   when a sequence's literal+match bytes fit but the SIMD wildcopy
//!   overshoot would not, the trailing sequence(s) take the bounded
//!   (non-overshooting) copy in [`UserSliceBackend::exec_sequence_bounded`].
//! - No active dictionary (the persistent dict_content is not
//!   carried into the stack-local DecodeBuffer this backend
//!   builds; dict frames stay on the regular path).
//!
//! `content_checksum_flag` is NOT a precondition: when set, the
//! direct-decode caller accumulates the frame XXH64 incrementally —
//! after each block it hashes that block's freshly-written bytes via
//! [`UserSliceBackend::written_since`] while they are still
//! cache-resident — and stores the final digest into the persistent
//! scratch's hasher so `get_calculated_checksum()` reads the right
//! value. (A single end-of-frame walk re-read the whole output cold:
//! one full extra memory pass on large frames.)
//!
//! Multi-segment frames work via the caller's per-block
//! `DecodeBuffer::drop_to_window_size` invocation — bytes drop
//! out of `len()`'s visible range once decoded output exceeds
//! `window_size`, but physically stay in the user's slice (this
//! backend's `drop_first_n` only advances `head`).
//!
//! The `drop_to_window_size` call runs only BETWEEN blocks, so
//! within a single block `len()` can temporarily exceed
//! `window_size`. `DecodeBuffer::repeat` validates match offsets
//! against `len()` (not `window_size`), so this is not a strict
//! enforcement of the spec's `offset <= window_size` rule — only
//! a coarse end-of-block cap. The fallback path
//! (`FlatBuf`/`RingBuffer`) shares the same limitation. Strict
//! in-block offset bounds would require additional validation
//! that neither path currently performs.
//!
//! When eligible, literal pushes and match-history copies write
//! directly into the user's slice. Compared to
//! `DecodeBuffer<FlatBuf>`, this elides one full `memmove` of the
//! live region (the `read` drain that copies the flat Vec into the
//! user slice) and one anonymous-page allocation cycle per frame.
//! On `level_-7_fast/decodecorpus-z000033/rust_stream` the
//! direct-write path measured -20.33% vs the FlatBuf+drain path on
//! i9-9900K — see #244 for the flamegraph.
//!
//! Selected at compile time via `DecodeBuffer<UserSliceBackend<'a>>`
//! (generic [`BufferBackend`](super::buffer_backend::BufferBackend)
//! parameter). The lifetime parameter binds the backend to the
//! user-provided slice — the backing
//! `DecodeBuffer<UserSliceBackend<'a>>` is stack-local in
//! `decode_all` and does not survive across calls. Persistent
//! decoder state (HUF/FSE tables, offset_hist, sequence cache)
//! lives in `FrameDecoder` and is borrowed in by reference for the
//! call's duration via [`super::scratch::DirectScratch`].
