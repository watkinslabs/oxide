//! Zstandard encoder — frame compression, streaming, dictionary support.
//!
//! Four entry points cover the common use cases:
//!
//! * [`compress`] — one-shot helper that builds a self-contained
//!   Zstandard frame from a `Read` source to a `Write` sink. The
//!   input is consumed incrementally from `Read`, so input buffering
//!   stays bounded; however, the compressed output is buffered in
//!   memory until the frame is complete so the Frame Content Size
//!   field can be filled in the header — peak memory is
//!   `O(compressed_size)` (worst-case `O(input_size)` for
//!   incompressible payloads, plus a small frame overhead). The
//!   savings vs [`compress_to_vec`] come from not materialising the
//!   input alongside the output.
//! * [`compress_to_vec`] — same one-shot path as [`compress`] but
//!   the input is eagerly drained into an internal `Vec` first
//!   (`read_to_end`) so the encoder can be handed a `&[u8]` and a
//!   precise source-size hint. Peak memory is therefore ≈
//!   `input_size + output_size`; prefer [`compress`] or
//!   [`StreamingEncoder`] when the input is large or unbounded.
//! * [`StreamingEncoder`] — implements [`crate::io::Write`], which
//!   re-exports [`std::io::Write`] under the `std` feature and falls
//!   back to a `no_std`-friendly trait otherwise. Accepts bytes
//!   incrementally and flushes compressed output as blocks fill.
//!   Requires `set_pledged_content_size` before the first write if
//!   the Frame Content Size field is to be populated.
//! * [`FrameCompressor`] — lower-level builder that owns the matcher and
//!   the per-frame configuration; the streaming and one-shot helpers are
//!   thin wrappers over it. Reach for it when you need to swap in a custom
//!   [`Matcher`] implementation or share the matcher across frames.
//!
//! Compression intensity is selected via [`CompressionLevel`], which
//! provides both named presets (`Fastest`, `Default`, `Better`, `Best`) and
//! numeric levels (`from_level(n)`) that mirror C zstd's level numbering
//! (negative for ultra-fast, `0` = default, `1..=22` for the standard
//! range).
//!
//! All produced frames are valid RFC 8878 Zstandard streams and decode
//! through both this crate's [`crate::decoding`] module and upstream C zstd.
//!
//! For memory budgeting, [`estimated_compression_workspace_bytes`] reports
//! the approximate steady-state heap footprint of a one-shot compression at
//! a given level (window + match-finder tables + block staging).
