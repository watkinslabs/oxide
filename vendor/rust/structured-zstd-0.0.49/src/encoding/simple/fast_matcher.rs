//! Upstream zstd-shape Fast strategy matcher backend — selected for every
//! Fast-strategy level (Uncompressed, Fastest, Level(1), and the
//! negative Level(-7..=-1) variants). Per-level dispatch on
//! `(fast_hash_log, fast_mls, fast_step_size)` is wired through
//! `LevelParams` → `with_params` / `reset` (step_size is part of
//! the construction/reset signature, not a separate setter).
//! Level(1) uses `(hash_log=14, mls=7, step_size=2)`; Fastest /
//! Uncompressed / Level(-1..=-7) use `(hash_log=14, mls=6)` with
//! `step_size` 2..8 driving upstream zstd's acceleration gradient on
//! negative levels.
//!
//! `use_cmov` is derived directly from `window_log` inside the
//! matcher (upstream zstd heuristic `windowLog < 19`) — NOT a
//! `LevelParams` field.
//!
//! Wraps the kernel from
//! [`super::fast_kernel::kernel::compress_block_fast`] and presents the
//! `Matcher` API expected by [`crate::encoding::match_generator::MatchGeneratorDriver`].
//! Replaces the SuffixStore-based `MatchGenerator` for the Fast strategy
//! path with a upstream zstd-parity hash table and tight per-block loop.
//!
//! Wired into production: [`crate::encoding::match_generator::MatcherStorage::Simple`]
//! holds `FastKernelMatcher` directly; the driver's Matcher trait
//! methods (`commit_space` / `start_matching` / `skip_matching_with_hint`
//! / `reset` / `prime_with_dictionary` / `trim_after_budget_retire`)
//! all route through this module's inherent API.
//!
//! # Invariants this module guarantees
//!
//! - `prefix_start_index >= INITIAL_PREFIX_START_INDEX = 1` at all
//!   times. `history` holds real input bytes from position 0
//!   onward (no dummy region — M8 dropped the seeded sentinel byte
//!   for upstream zstd byte-range parity). Sentinel-0 protection comes from
//!   the kernel's `match_idx >= prefix_start_index` filter rejecting
//!   the hash table's empty-slot value `0`. After eviction / drain
//!   the buffer is rebased to position 0 and `prefix_start_index`
//!   resets to 1, making the first retained byte (`history[0]`)
//!   unmatchable — small ratio cost, accepted for sentinel safety.
//! - `history.len()` is bounded by `2 × max_window_size` post-append.
//!   See [`FastKernelMatcher::extend_history_with_pending`].
//! - `rep[0..2]` is the functional repcode state: the kernel's
//!   two-deep stack, overwritten from `FastBlockResult.rep` after every
//!   `start_matching`, and what the NEXT block's kernel probes against.
//!   `offset_hist[0..3]` is NOT mutated by matching — the Fast backend
//!   drives repcodes off `rep`, and the wire-offset repcode coding is
//!   done downstream by `encode_raw_sequences_into` against the encode
//!   pipeline's OWN offset history, so a per-match
//!   `encode_offset_with_history` on the matcher would be redundant.
//!   `offset_hist` is therefore only seeded by `prime_offset_history`
//!   (which also sets `rep`) and otherwise stays at its `reset` default.
//!   Do NOT reintroduce per-match `offset_hist` rotation here: it is
//!   pure overhead on this backend (it was removed because the coded
//!   offset it produced was discarded).
