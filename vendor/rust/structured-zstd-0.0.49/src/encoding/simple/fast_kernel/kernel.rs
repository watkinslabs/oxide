/// # Arguments

///   prefix all the way to `bounds.prefix_start_index`.
/// - `bounds: PrefixBounds`: bundle of two upstream zstd-derived absolute
///   floors (kept together so the kernel signature stays inside the
///   clippy 7-argument cap). See [`PrefixBounds`] field docs for the
///   exact semantics:
///   - `prefix_start_index`: sentinel-aware match-table filter (rejects
///     the all-zero empty-slot value at position 0).
///   - `window_low`: upstream zstd `windowLow`-equivalent absolute floor used
///     by the prologue's `max_rep` computation and the backward-extension
///     `match_pos > window_low` bound.
/// - `hash_table`: the encoder's `FastHashTable`. Mutated in place;
///   entries are absolute indices into `data`.
/// - `rep`: incoming `[rep_offset1, rep_offset2]` from the previous
///   block. Returned updated in `FastBlockResult.rep`.
/// - `step_size`: upstream zstd `stepSize = targetLength + !(targetLength) + 1`
///   (min 2). Drives the initial step in the 4-cursor skip schedule.
/// - `handle_sequence`: closure that the kernel invokes once per
///   emitted `Sequence` — equivalent to upstream zstd's `ZSTD_storeSeq`.
///
/// # Preconditions / algorithm invariants
///
/// `compress_block_fast` is a SAFE function — memory-safety holds for
/// every input that doesn't trigger one of the entry-time
/// `assert!`s (see the **Panics** section below for that list). The
/// contract below is about algorithmic correctness (correct output
/// sequences, upstream zstd-parity match coverage), not Rust memory safety.
/// Passing a smaller `data` is well-defined but the kernel falls
/// into the short-input early-return branch and emits no sequences,
/// which may not be what the caller wanted.
///
/// # Panics
///
/// Entry-time `assert!`s reject misuse loudly in every build (debug
/// AND release) rather than silently miscompressing:
/// - `block_start > data.len()` — invalidates the block range and
///   breaks the arithmetic used by both code paths: in the
///   short-input branch `tail_literals_len = data.len() -
///   block_start` underflows; in the main loop
///   `block_start + HASH_READ_SIZE` can wrap and skip the
///   short-input early-return entirely, then `base.add(ip0)`
///   reads out of bounds. Either side is a clean panic instead
///   of UB / garbage output.
/// - `data.len() > u32::MAX as usize` — the kernel stores
///   absolute positions into a u32 hash table and computes offsets
///   as u32, so larger inputs would silently truncate match indices.
/// - `MLS` outside `4..=8` — the upstream zstd's Fast strategy supports
///   only mls 4..=8; out-of-range MLS would route to a
///   non-existent hash formula.
/// - `MLS` != `hash_table.mls()` — a mismatched table layout would
///   cause the kernel to hash with the wrong formula and probe
///   entries indexed by a different formula, leading to garbage
///   match candidates.
///
/// The remaining-block length `data.len() - block_start` SHOULD be
/// at least `HASH_READ_SIZE` (8) bytes — `data` itself may be much
/// longer because it holds the prefix history before `block_start`,
/// so the slice's total size is not the relevant gate. The kernel's
/// short-input early-return (line below) compares precisely
/// `data.len() < block_start + HASH_READ_SIZE`, matching this
/// remaining-block phrasing.
///
/// The `ilimit = data.len() - HASH_READ_SIZE` cap constrains where
/// the main loop hashes and probes — i.e. it stops emitting new
/// matches once `ip0 >= ilimit`. It does NOT mean the trailing 7
/// bytes are ALWAYS literals: an in-progress forward match found at
/// `ip0 < ilimit` extends through `count_forward` and can reach all
/// the way to `iend`, leaving `tail_literals_len = 0`. The kernel
/// reports the actual number of trailing literal bytes (zero or
/// more) in `FastBlockResult.tail_literals_len`, and the caller
/// emits a terminal `Sequence::Literals` only when that value is
/// non-zero.
///
/// # Sequence emission contract
///
/// The kernel emits ONLY `Sequence::Triple` callbacks — one per
/// emitted match (repcode or explicit). Each `Triple` carries the
/// literal-run that precedes the match in its `literals` field, so
/// the kernel never needs a separate `Sequence::Literals` mid-block
/// call. The trailing bytes from the last anchor to the end of
/// `data` are NOT emitted via the closure; they are accounted for
/// by `FastBlockResult.tail_literals_len`, and emitting them as
/// the terminal `Sequence::Literals` (or absorbing them however
/// the caller wants) is the caller's responsibility. This rule
/// applies UNIFORMLY across every exit branch, including the
/// short-input early-return; without that uniformity a caller
/// wrapping the kernel's output would have to special-case "did
/// the kernel already emit the tail" per branch, which is exactly
/// the inconsistency this contract removes.
