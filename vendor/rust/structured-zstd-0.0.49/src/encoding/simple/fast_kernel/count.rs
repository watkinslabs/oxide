//! Forward match-length counter — direct port of upstream zstd's `ZSTD_count`
//! from `lib/compress/zstd_compress_internal.h`. Compares `pIn` against
//! `pMatch` in `usize`-sized chunks via XOR, falls back to a u32 / u16
//! / u8 tail. The first mismatching byte is located via
//! `trailing_zeros()/8` (little-endian) or `leading_zeros()/8`
//! (big-endian) on the XOR difference, matching upstream zstd's
//! `ZSTD_NbCommonBytes`.
//!
//! The chunk type is `usize` — `u64` on 64-bit hosts, `u32` on 32-bit —
//! to match upstream zstd's `MEM_readST` (`size_t`) loads. On 32-bit targets a
//! u64 chunk would compile to two adjacent 32-bit loads + a 64-bit
//! XOR; using native pointer width keeps the inner loop a single load
//! per pointer per iteration.

/// Count the number of bytes that match starting at `ip` against the
/// reference at `match_ptr`, up to (but not including) `iend`. Returns
/// the match length in bytes — `0` if `*ip != *match_ptr`.
///
/// # Safety
///
/// - `ip` MUST point to `ip_len = (iend as usize) - (ip as usize)`
///   readable bytes. `iend` is the exclusive upper bound; the function
///   never reads at or past it.
/// - `match_ptr` MUST point to at least as many readable bytes as `ip`
///   does up to `iend`. In practice this is naturally satisfied when
///   `match_ptr <= ip` and both pointers live inside the same buffer
///   (a backward match into the encoder's history), since the function
///   only reads chunks from `match_ptr` for the same byte ranges it
///   reads from `ip` — `iend` caps both equally. A naive "trailing 7
///   slack on match_ptr" reading would be overspecified: the 8-byte
///   chunked-load body bails on the first non-matching byte, so the
///   read length on `match_ptr` is always `min(ip_len, common_bytes
///   + chunk_padding)` ≤ what `ip` itself reads.
/// - Neither pointer's range may overlap the destination of a
///   concurrent write — the kernel runs single-threaded over a
///   block-local input slice so this holds by construction.
