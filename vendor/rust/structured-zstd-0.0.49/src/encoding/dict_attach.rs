//! Shared CDict-style dictionary-attach lifecycle, parameterized by the
//! matcher's immutable dictionary table type `T`.
//!
//! This is the level-1 scaffolding common to every match-finder backend that
//! supports upstream zstd `ZSTD_dictMatchState` attach-by-reference: instead of
//! re-priming the whole dictionary into the live hash table(s) on every frame
//! (O(dict) per frame, the dominant cost on small-payload `compress-dict`), the
//! dictionary is hashed ONCE into a SEPARATE immutable table `T` held here, and
//! the kernel dual-probes the live table(s) plus this dict table. A reused
//! compressor keeps `T` across the per-frame `reset` (the dict re-commits to the
//! same absolute history positions) via the `primed` cache flag — mirroring
//! C copying / referencing `cdict->matchState` rather than rebuilding it.
//!
//! `T` is backend-specific (Fast = single `FastHashTable`; Dfast = a long+short
//! pair; Row/HC/BT = their own structures); the per-backend BUILD of `T` and the
//! per-kernel dual-probe LOOKUP are level-2 (kept in each backend, expanded per
//! SIMD tier). This type only owns the shared lifecycle: presence, the
//! dict/input boundary, the build-once cache flag, and invalidation.
