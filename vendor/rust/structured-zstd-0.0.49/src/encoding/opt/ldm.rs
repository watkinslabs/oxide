//! Long-distance-match (LDM) integration types for the optimal parser.
//!
//! Upstream zstd parity: mirrors `optLdm_t` and `rawSeq` from `zstd_opt.c`.
//! The optimal parser consumes pre-computed LDM sequences (one per long
//! match window) and weaves them into candidate selection via
//! `ldm_process_match_candidate`.
//!
//! Extracted from `match_generator.rs` as part of #111 Phase 1
//! (structural split). Names, fields, and derives are preserved;
//! visibility was opened to `pub(crate)` so `match_generator` can
//! import the relocated items through `super::opt::ldm::*`. The
//! matcher methods that operate on these types remain on
//! `HcMatchGenerator` for now. The actual LDM *matcher* (gear hash +
//! bucket table) is scoped for #111 Phase 5 (implements #18).
