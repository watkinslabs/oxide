//! Plain-data types used by the optimal-parser DP and traceback.
//!
//! Extracted from `match_generator.rs` as part of #111 Phase 1
//! (structural split). Names, fields, derives, and `Default` impls are
//! preserved; the only intentional internal-API change is the
//! `pub(crate)` visibility on each item so the remaining methods on
//! `HcMatchGenerator` can import them through
//! `super::opt::types::{…}` (no re-exports are added at `opt::`).
//! Methods that operate on these types stay on `HcMatchGenerator` for
//! now and migrate in later phases.
