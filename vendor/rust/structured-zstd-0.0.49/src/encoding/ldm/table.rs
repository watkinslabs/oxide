//! Bucket-based hash table for the LDM producer.
//!
//! Direct port of the table portion of `ldmState_t` and the
//! `ZSTD_ldm_getBucket` / `ZSTD_ldm_insertEntry` helpers from
//! `lib/compress/zstd_ldm.c` v1.5.7.
//!
//! Layout (upstream zstd `zstd_ldm.c:188-207`):
//!
//! ```text
//! entries: [LdmEntry; 1 << hash_log]
//!   = bucket_count buckets of `1 << bucket_size_log` slots each
//!
//! bucket_offsets: [u8; bucket_count]
//!   = round-robin write cursor per bucket (upstream zstd uses one BYTE)
//!
//! bucket_count = 1 << (hash_log - bucket_size_log)
//! ```
//!
//! Lookup is a bare slice into `entries`; insertion is a single
//! 64-bit write plus a one-byte modular cursor bump. There is no
//! eviction policy beyond the round-robin overwrite, which mirrors
//! upstream zstd's behaviour and is correct because LDM tolerates dropped
//! candidates (the verify step rejects stale entries via the
//! checksum + window-distance check).
//!
//! Upstream zstd `bucket_size_log` is silently clamped to `hash_log`
//! (`zstd_ldm.c:176`); the same clamp lives in [`LdmHashTable::new`].
//!
//! See [`super::params::LdmParams`] for how the logs are derived.
