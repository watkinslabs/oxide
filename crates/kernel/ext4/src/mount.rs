// Mount ownership split for the ext4 mount layer.
//
// Module manifest:
// - core: mount open path, cached state, metadata shadowing, and GDT access.
// - blocks: inode reads, extent walks, file-block I/O, and inode flag helpers.
// - dirs: directory mutation, directory lookup, and absolute path walk.
// - io: raw byte-range block-device helpers shared by sibling modules.
